This repository includes filtering and RDA scripts for freshwater kōura | kēkēwai (freshwater crayfish, _Paranephrops zealandicus_) Genotyping-By-Sequencing data associated with _Evolutionary Applications_ manuscript 'Weaving place-based knowledge for culturally significant species in the age of genomics: Looking to the past to navigate the future'

Genomic data derived from taoka (treasured) species such as freshwater kōura are taoka (treasures) in their own right. Accordingly, the assembled short-read reference genome for kōura, unfiltered GBS VCFs, and associated metadata will be made available on recommendation of the papatipu rūnaka that affiliate as kaitiaki (guardians) for kōura from a local genome browser: http://www.ucconsert.org/data/.
